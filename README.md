****
A first stab at predicting house prices in the Greater London area.
****
We used data from HM Land Registry and geo-spatial coordinates of out-codes
to predict the prices of residential terraced properties in the Greater London 
area. 
The key feature was found to be distance from the centre.
We started with Linear Regression, improved quality of fit with Decision Trees
and turbo-charged the model using an ensemble of trees (Random Forest).
We note the stability of the fit both over time and training_test splits.
